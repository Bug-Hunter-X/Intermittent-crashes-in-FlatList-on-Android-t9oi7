# React Native FlatList Crash on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent crashes in a React Native FlatList component on Android. The crash is due to a race condition that occurs when data is updated while the component is rendering. This issue is not reproducible on iOS.

## Bug Description

A React Native application using FlatList experiences intermittent crashes on Android devices. The crashes occur seemingly randomly when new data is fetched and updated in the FlatList. The application works fine on iOS devices.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
3. Observe the app's behavior; it may crash after some time. Note that the crash is not guaranteed to occur on every run. 

## Solution

The solution involves using the `useMemo` hook to memoize the rendering of the FlatList data, preventing unnecessary re-renders and reducing the chance of race conditions causing the crash.  The solution also involves a better error handling mechanism.
